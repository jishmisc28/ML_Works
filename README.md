Created a app using Java and Scikit ML libraries to predict the macro nutrient of the food item by training a KNN model on the sample recorset (5000) from the open source USDA National Nutrient Database on a day long Hackathon.   

Cleaned and feature engineered sample dataset is uploaded along with the .py file containing the model. The model had a accuracy of 89% on the training data (due to less volume) and about 72% on the test dataset.
